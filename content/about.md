HawaiiDiff is a collection of camera snapshots from the observatories on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The site aggregates images from various telescopes and facilities to provide a real-time view of conditions at one of the world's premier astronomical research sites.

## The Cameras

The cameras featured on this site come from multiple world-class observatories including:

- **Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)**
- **Gemini Observatory**
- **NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF)**
- **James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)**
- **W. M. Keck Observatory**
- **Subaru Telescope**
- **United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)**
- **Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)**

## Image Sources

All images are aggregated from the [Maunakea Weather Center and Center for Maunakea Stewardship](http://mkwc.ifa.hawaii.edu/current/cams/index.cgi?mode=multi) of the University of Hawai ªi at Hilo.

## About the Site

HawaiiDiff was created by [Den Delimarsky](https://den.dev) to make it easier to view and track changes in weather conditions and telescope operations at Mauna Kea.

Snapshots are collected periodically and converted to WebP format for efficient delivery. The site maintains the current snapshot plus 10 historical snapshots for each camera.

## Technology

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. Images are automatically fetched and processed using a custom collection script.
