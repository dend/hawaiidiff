# Feature Specification: Telescope Search and Direction Filter

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a filter on the main landing page that will allow me to search existing telescopes and allow me to filter by direction the telescope is facing."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: Where should the search box and direction filters be positioned on the page? → A: Filters appear above the camera grid (search box + direction buttons horizontally aligned)
- Q: How should users interact with the direction filters to select/deselect them? → A: Dropdown menu with checkboxes inside
- Q: What should be displayed in the camera grid area when there are no matching results? → A: Centered message in grid area with "Clear all filters" action button
- Q: What should happen to active filters when the camera data is updated? → A: Not applicable - data only updates when site is rebuilt, which causes page refresh and filter reset
- Q: How should the filter controls behave on small mobile screens? → A: Filters collapse into a "Show Filters" button that expands a panel

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Search Telescopes by Name (Priority: P1)

A visitor to the website wants to quickly find a specific telescope camera by typing part of its name instead of scrolling through all available cameras.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental feature - enabling users to quickly locate specific telescopes is the primary value proposition. Without search, the filter feature alone would be less useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing telescope names into a search box and verifying that only matching cameras are displayed. Delivers immediate value by reducing time to find specific cameras.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user types "CFHT" in the search box, **Then** only cameras with "CFHT" in their name are displayed
2. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user types "gemini" (lowercase), **Then** all Gemini cameras are displayed (case-insensitive search)
3. **Given** a user has typed a search term, **When** they clear the search box, **Then** all cameras are displayed again
4. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user types "xyz123" (no matching cameras), **Then** a "no results found" message is displayed
5. **Given** a user is typing in the search box, **When** they type each character, **Then** results update in real-time without requiring a submit button

### User Story 2 - Filter Telescopes by Direction (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to see only the telescope cameras facing a specific direction (e.g., North, South, East, West) to compare views from that orientation.

**Why this priority**: This adds significant value for users interested in specific viewing angles but depends on having a usable interface to work with. It's complementary to search but not the primary use case.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by selecting direction filters and verifying that only cameras facing the selected direction(s) are shown. Delivers value for users comparing views from specific orientations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user opens the direction filter dropdown and checks the "North" checkbox, **Then** only cameras with direction "N" are displayed
2. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user opens the direction filter dropdown and checks multiple direction checkboxes (e.g., "North" and "South"), **Then** cameras facing either North or South are displayed
3. **Given** a user has selected a direction filter, **When** they uncheck it in the dropdown, **Then** all cameras are displayed again
4. **Given** the landing page loads, **When** no filters are selected, **Then** all cameras are visible by default
5. **Given** cameras are displayed, **When** a user selects a direction with no matching cameras, **Then** a "no results found" message is displayed

### User Story 3 - Combine Search and Direction Filters (Priority: P3)

A visitor wants to search for telescope cameras using both name search and direction filters simultaneously to narrow down results precisely.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced use case that enhances the experience but requires both P1 and P2 to be implemented first. It's valuable but represents a smaller subset of user needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying both search text and direction filters together, verifying that results match both criteria. Delivers value for users with very specific viewing requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the landing page displays all telescope cameras, **When** a user types "CFHT" and selects "North" direction, **Then** only CFHT cameras facing North are displayed
2. **Given** a user has both search and direction filters active, **When** they clear the search text, **Then** only the direction filter remains active
3. **Given** a user has both search and direction filters active, **When** they clear the direction filter, **Then** only the search filter remains active
4. **Given** a user has filters applied, **When** they clear all filters, **Then** all cameras are displayed again

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a camera has an unusual direction value (e.g., "Up", "Hilo", "ESE", "NW")? These values are displayed as-is in the filter dropdown.
- How does the system handle cameras with missing or null direction values? They are excluded from direction-based filtering but still appear when no direction filter is active.
- What happens when search results combined with direction filters produce zero matches? A centered "no results found" message with a "Clear all filters" button is displayed in the grid area.
- How does the filter interface behave on small mobile screens? Filter controls collapse into a "Show Filters" button that expands a panel containing search and direction controls.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a text search input field visible on the main landing page, positioned above the camera grid
- **FR-002**: System MUST filter displayed cameras in real-time as users type in the search field
- **FR-003**: Search MUST be case-insensitive (e.g., "cfht" matches "CFHT")
- **FR-004**: Search MUST match partial telescope names (e.g., "gem" matches "Gemini North")
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide direction filter controls visible on the main landing page, positioned above the camera grid and horizontally aligned with the search box
- **FR-006**: Direction filters MUST display all unique direction values found in the camera data
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to select multiple direction filters simultaneously using checkboxes within a dropdown menu
- **FR-008**: When both search and direction filters are active, results MUST match both criteria (AND logic)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a "no results found" message centered in the grid area when filters produce zero matches
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a "Clear all filters" action button within the no results message that resets all active filters
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve the visual grid layout of camera cards when filtering
- **FR-012**: Filter controls MUST be accessible via keyboard navigation
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle non-standard direction values (e.g., "Up", "Hilo", "ESE", "NW") by displaying them as-is in filter options
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle cameras with missing direction values by excluding them from direction-based filtering
- **FR-015**: Filter state MUST reset when the page is refreshed (no persistence across sessions)
- **FR-016**: On small mobile screens (below a responsive breakpoint), filter controls MUST collapse into a "Show Filters" button that expands a panel containing the search box and direction dropdown

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Telescope Camera**: Represents a camera feed with properties including unique identifier, display name, direction facing, and image source. The camera data already exists in the system.
- **Direction**: A compass direction or orientation indicator (e.g., N, S, E, W, NE, SW, Up, Hilo) associated with each camera.
- **Filter State**: The current combination of search text and selected direction values that determine which cameras are visible.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
