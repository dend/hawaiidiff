# Tasks: Telescope Search and Direction Filter

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-i-want-to/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì, data-model.md ‚úì, contracts/ ‚úì

**Tests**: No test tasks included - manual browser testing specified in plan.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Static site structure at repository root
- Templates: `layouts/`, partials: `layouts/partials/`
- Assets: `assets/css/`, `assets/js/`
- Data: `data/cameras.json` (existing, no modifications)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US2 being complete (integrates both)
- **Mobile & Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - can start immediately after Foundational phase
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Independent - can start immediately after Foundational phase (parallel with US1 if staffed)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 and US2 - integrates search + direction filtering

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Search)**:
- HTML/CSS tasks (T012, T013) can run in parallel
- JavaScript state management (T014) before filtering logic (T015-T020)
- Core filtering (T015-T017) before event handling (T018-T019)
- No-results handling (T020-T021) after core filtering works
- Testing (T022-T027) after implementation complete

**User Story 2 (Direction)**:
- HTML/CSS tasks (T028, T029) can run in parallel
- Toggle button generation (T030) before filtering logic (T031-T034)
- Testing (T035-T041) after implementation complete

**User Story 3 (Combined)**:
- Combine logic (T042-T043) first
- Clear filters feature (T044-T047) after combine logic
- Testing (T048-T054) after implementation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T002 and T003 can run in parallel (different files)

**Foundational Phase**:
- T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel (CSS and HTML in different files)
- T008, T009, T010, T011 can run in parallel (independent utility functions)

**User Story 1**:
- T012 (HTML) and T013 (CSS) can run in parallel
- After US1 complete AND Foundational complete: US2 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)

**User Story 2**:
- T028 (HTML) and T029 (CSS) can run in parallel

**Mobile & Polish Phase**:
- T055, T056, T057, T058 can run in parallel (independent CSS/HTML)
- T080, T081, T082 can run in parallel (different validation activities)
- T083, T084, T085 can run in parallel (cleanup in different files)

# Step 2: JavaScript core (sequential)
Task T030: "Call createDirectionToggleButtons() in initCameraFilter()"
Task T031: "Implement matchesDirection() function in assets/js/main.js"
Task T032: "Update applyFilters() to include direction filtering"

# Step 3: Event handling

## MVP Recommendation

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Story 1 only (Search by Name - Tasks T001-T027)

**Rationale**:
- Delivers immediate value (SC-001: find camera in <5 seconds)
- Independently testable and deployable
- ~2-3 hours implementation time for experienced developer
- Validates core filtering architecture before adding direction complexity

**Incremental Delivery Path**:
1. **MVP (US1)**: Deploy search functionality ‚Üí gather user feedback
2. **V1.1 (US1+US2)**: Add direction filtering with toggle buttons ‚Üí more advanced users can filter by view
3. **V1.2 (US1+US2+US3)**: Polish combined filtering ‚Üí power users get precise results
4. **V2.0 (All+Mobile)**: Add mobile responsive design ‚Üí mobile users get optimized experience
