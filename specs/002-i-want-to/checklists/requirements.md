## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED (2025-10-14)

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. All requirements are clearly defined, testable, and technology-agnostic. The feature is well-scoped with clear user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and measurable success outcomes.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: Search, P2: Direction Filter, P3: Combined)
- Each story is independently testable
- Comprehensive edge case coverage including non-standard direction values
- All success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- No implementation details - purely focused on what and why, not how
