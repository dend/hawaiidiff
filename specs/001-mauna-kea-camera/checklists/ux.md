**Total Items**: 70  
**Completed**: 68 ✓  
**Remaining**: 2 (CHK042: Page transitions not in scope, CHK061: Icons not yet specified)

**Coverage**: Visual Design (8/8), Typography (5/5), Interaction States (6/6), Clarity (5/5), Consistency (6/6), Measurability (6/6), Scenarios (12/13), Accessibility (11/11), Performance (3/3), Dependencies (2/3)

**Summary**:
- ✅ All critical ambiguities resolved (CHK065-CHK068)
- ✅ All visual design requirements specified as outcomes (what) in spec.md
- ✅ All technical implementation details (how) moved to plan.md Implementation Specifications
- ✅ All interaction states fully defined with transitions and timing in plan.md
- ✅ All accessibility requirements specified with ARIA patterns in plan.md
- ✅ All error/edge case visual treatments documented
- ✅ Responsive design fully specified across 3 breakpoints
- ⚠️ Page navigation transitions intentionally excluded (static site, instant navigation)
- ⚠️ Icon specifications needed for camera-off, navigation, and directional icons

**Spec/Plan Separation**:
- ✅ Spec.md: Contains "what" and "why" - user-facing requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Plan.md: Contains "how" - exact pixel values, CSS properties, hex codes, implementation patterns
- ✅ All FR requirements now describe outcomes, not implementation methods
- ✅ Technical specifications organized by FR mapping in plan.md Implementation Specifications section

**Impact**: Specification is now implementation-ready with proper separation of concerns between requirements (spec) and implementation (plan).
