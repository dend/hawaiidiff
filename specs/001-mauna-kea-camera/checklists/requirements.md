# Specification Quality Checklist: Mauna Kea Camera Snapshot Visualizer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Validation Details**:
- Spec contains 3 prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios
- 12 functional requirements are specific, testable, and technology-agnostic
- 6 success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Edge cases address common failure scenarios
- Assumptions document dependencies and constraints
- No implementation details (frameworks, languages, databases) are specified
- All content focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
